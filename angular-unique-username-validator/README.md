# Unique username validator in Angular

This code shows how to implement unique username validator in Angular. This is useful in registration forms and other similar places where user should enter unique username.
The same mechanism can be used to validate email uniqueness as well as other data. Similar approach can be used also for other kind of asynchronous validations which need to call HTTP endpoint.
There is an article on my blog describing this example more thoroughly so check it if you are interested in more details: https://woroniecki.pl/angular-unique-username-validator/
